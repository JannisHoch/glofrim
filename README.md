# GLOFRIM 2.0
Globally Applicable Framework for Integrated Hydrological-Hydrodynamic Modelling (GLOFRIM)

development by Jannis M. Hoch (Utrecht University, Deltares), Dirk Eilander (VU Amsterdam, Deltares), and Hiroaki Ikeuchi (University of Tokyo)
contact: Jannis M. Hoch (j.m.hoch@uu.nl)

We also want to acknowledge the contributions of all colleagues at the insitues involved in the development of GLOFRIM.

# Manual
GLOFRIM is designed to provide a flexible and modular tool to couple hydrologic, routing, and hydodynamic models across scales.
The coupling process is spatially explicit (i.e. on grid-to-grid basis) and model information is exchanged per (daily) time step.
To establish this coupling scheme, the functions of the Basic Model Interface (BMI) are utilized.

While version 1 allowed for coupling PCR-GLOBWB with either Delft3D Flexible Mesh or LISFLOOD-FP, we extended the framework such that it
now also caters the hydrologic modelling suite WFLOW and the global routing model CaMa-Flood.

With the available models, either 2-step or 3-step step model coupling can be performed.
 - 2-step coupling: hydrology->routing or hydrology->hydrodynamics
 - 3-step coupling: hydrology->routing->hydrodynamics

Currently, the coupling process in only one-directional, i.e. only downstream along the model cascade.
Work is currently performed to extend it to a full feedback loop.

The framework has successfully been tested on Linux platforms. 
Please note that it running it on Windows is currently not supported.

## Content of package
 - glofrim-py: python package containing the functions required to execute the various coupling models
 - pcrglobwb-bmi_v203: BMI-compatible PCR-GLOBWB model supporting application at 30 arcmin resolution
 - glofrim.ini: example ini-file where the models as well as the exchanged fluxes/paths are specified

## Running the script:
GLOFRIM can be executed as follows on Linux command lines:\
python glofrim_runner.py run /path/to/glofrim.ini

Besides, additional arguments can be provided:
 - --env: file containing local paths to model executables
 - -s: start time (yyyy-mm-dd)
 - -e: end time (yyyy-mm-dd)

## Model specs
 - PCR-GLOBWB: since the model does not generically contain BMI function, a bespoke version is provided with the GLOFRIM package.
 - Delft3D Flexible Mesh: the model is freely available, but currently needs to be requested; version 1.1.201 or higher is required   
 - LISFLOOD-FP: version 5.9 extended with BMI-functionality is available at GitLab
 - WFLOW: the latest version is required for full functionality and can be downloaded from GitHub
 - CaMa-Flood: a BMI'ed version of CaMa-Flood (v3.6.2) is available upon request
